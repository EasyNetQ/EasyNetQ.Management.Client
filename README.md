## EasyNetQ.Management.Client

EasyNetQ.Management.Client is a .NET client proxy for the RabbitMQ Management API. This lets you control all aspects for your
RabbitMQ broker from .NET code, including creating virtual hosts and users; setting permissions; monitoring queues, 
connections and channels; and setting up exchanges, queues and bindings. It is part of the [EasyNetQ](http://easynetq.com) project.
